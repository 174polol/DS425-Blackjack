# DS425: Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Difference Learning

This repository contains a reinforcement learning project where an agent is created using the temporal difference learning method. The environment used for this project is the Blackjack-v0 simulation environment provided by OpenAI Gym.

## Installation

To run this project, first, you need to install the OpenAI Gym library along with the Atari extension for the Blackjack-v0 environment. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```python
pip install gym
pip install gym[atari]
```

## The Environment

The Blackjack-v0 environment is a simulation of the Blackjack card game. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. In this project, the agent will use the temporal difference learning method to learn how to play Blackjack optimally.

## Usage

To run the project, you can simply execute the `main.py` file using Python. You can also modify the code and experiment with different hyperparameters to see how they affect the performance of the agent.
