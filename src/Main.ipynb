It's output is the same tuple as env.reset(), followed by the reward for last action, i.e. -1 for an action that made you lose (busting or sticking but having less than the dealer), 0 if you tie after sticking or not busting after hitting, and +1 for winning (sticking without busting but still having more than the dealer)."
